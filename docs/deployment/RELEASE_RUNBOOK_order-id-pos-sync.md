# Release Runbook — Order-ID Canonicalization + POS Live-Sync (Bucket B rollout)

**Release contents (now on `main` across all repos, 2026-06-02):**
NEX-CASE-013 (canonical `order_id` channels, broadcast layer, POS order-detail outbox/consumer,
`order.details.updated`) + PR #160 (refresh POS values before broadcast) · TAB-CASE-010 (tablet
canonical `order_id` + `order.details.updated` handler + `preparing`→`in_progress`) · TAB-CASE-009
(WS silent-death watchdog) · INFRA-CASE-003 (`npm ci` WiFi hardening).

**Also folded in (NEX-CASE-014, merged 2026-06-05 — deploy-script change, on `main`):** LAN session /
login 419 fix. `apply-woosoo-config.sh` now emits `SESSION_DOMAIN` empty so the cookie scopes to the
request host; no special operator config is needed (`WOOSOO_ENV` defaults to `production`). Verified in
**Step 1.5** below — it ships automatically with Step 1's config-apply.

This runbook is the **Bucket B (deploy-readiness) sequence** for the restaurant Pi. It wraps the
generic deploy in `docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`; do not duplicate that — follow the steps
below in order. Pi: static IP `192.168.1.31`, root `/opt/woosoo/woosoo-platform`. Run on the Pi.

> Each step is independently verifiable. **Stop and do not proceed** if a step's verification fails.

---

## Step 0 — Pre-flight
- Confirm the Pi is on `main` for all app repos and reachable: `cd /opt/woosoo/woosoo-platform && git -C . status`.
- `deploy-all.sh` runs `woosoo-backup.sh` (DB backup) and the `doctor.sh` preflight gate (inside the deploy step, after config is written) automatically — no separate action.

## Step 1 — Core deploy (pulls `main`, builds, health-checks)
```bash
# deploy.sh defaults NEXUS_BRANCH and TABLET_BRANCH to `dev` — must override for a main release
export WOOSOO_DEPLOY_BRANCH=main
echo "Deploy branch: $WOOSOO_DEPLOY_BRANCH"   # verify before proceeding
sudo -E bash scripts/deployment/deploy-all.sh
```
`-E` passes the exported variable into the sudo environment.
Runs check → backup → deploy → health. The `deploy` step does: pull repos → apply config (writes
`woosoo-nexus/.env`) → **doctor.sh gate** → hydrate deps + build fresh → migrate → `up` → warm cache.
The doctor gate runs after config hydration (so it validates the generated env and never blocks a
fresh machine) and gates build/migrate/up. The health step has grace + retry; on any failure the
wrapper prints a diagnosis bundle (`docker compose ps` + recent logs) plus the exact rollback command.
**Verify:** the wrapper exits `0` and `woosoo-health.sh` reports the stack healthy.
A green tablet build here (over the Pi's `wlan0`) is the live confirmation of **INFRA-CASE-003 → close #136**.
**Rollback if it fails:** `sudo bash scripts/deployment/rollback-client.sh <backup-dir>` (the wrapper prints the exact snapshot path on failure).

## Step 1.5 — LAN session / login (NEX-CASE-014)
Root cause (NEX-CASE-014, tracked in `state/QUEUE.md`): `SESSION_DOMAIN` was pinned to the box IP, so
IP-based LAN clients got **419** (cookie domain mismatch). The fix emits `SESSION_DOMAIN` empty
(`apply-woosoo-config.sh` `set_env "SESSION_DOMAIN" ""`); `config/session.php`'s `domain` closure then
returns `null` → the cookie scopes to whatever host the browser used (`woosoo.local` **or** the bare IP).

**Pre-req:** the platform repo at `/opt/woosoo/woosoo-platform` is pulled to current `main` (that's where
the script fix lives); `WOOSOO_ENV=production` (the default — no action needed unless overridden).

**Action:** none beyond Step 1 — the deploy's config-apply overwrites `SESSION_DOMAIN` to empty via
`set_env`, even if a stale value was pinned in the live `.env`. If a stale value somehow lingers, re-run Step 1.

**Verify:**
```bash
# Automated P0/P1 checks (preferred):
sudo bash scripts/deployment/pi-stability-verify.sh --host 192.168.1.31

# Manual fallback — SESSION_DOMAIN must echo empty:
grep SESSION_DOMAIN /opt/woosoo/woosoo-nexus/.env
# (or run scripts/deployment/legacy/verify-client.sh and read its "Environment identity" block)

# From a LAN device hitting the bare IP — Set-Cookie must have NO `domain=` attribute:
curl -k -i https://192.168.1.31/sanctum/csrf-cookie
```
Then in a browser **via the IP** (`https://192.168.1.31`): a bad-credentials login returns **422, not 419**,
and the session persists across requests. Tablet/device API calls are unaffected.
**Stop** if any request still returns 419.

> **Note (not blocking — out of scope here):** `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `apply-woosoo-config.sh` is
> hostname-only (no bare-IP origin). That's fine for same-origin admin login (419 is a session-domain
> issue, not CORS). If a future *cross-origin* IP caller hits a CORS/419 failure, file a separate case —
> do not bundle it into NEX-CASE-014.

## Step 2 — POS triggers + schedulers (NEX-CASE-007 + NEX-CASE-013)
Install/refresh the POS-local outbox tables + triggers (payment, session-close, **and the new
order-detail trigger from 013**), then confirm the consumers are scheduled. Run **inside the nexus
app container** (service name is `app` per `compose.yaml`):
```bash
docker compose exec app php artisan pos:setup-payment-trigger
docker compose exec app php artisan schedule:list | grep -E "pos:consume-payment-status-events|pos:consume-order-detail-events"
```
**Verify:** the command reports the outbox tables + triggers created; `schedule:list` shows **both**
`pos:consume-payment-status-events` (every 5s) and `pos:consume-order-detail-events` (every 5s).
Idempotent — safe to re-run.

## Step 3 — POS printer config — BT-only (NEX-CASE-011)
Root cause (docs/cases/nex-case-011): the 3rd-party POS prints autonomously from `create_ordered_menu`
while the Nexus BT path also prints → duplicate. Intended behavior is **BT thermal only**.

**Code gate (cleared):** PR #163 (`fix/nex-011-duplicate-print`) merged to dev 2026-06-04 — removes
`PrintOrder::dispatch()` from all `markPrinted` ack paths and adds `is_printed` idempotency guard.
Confirm this commit is on the deployed branch (Step 1 pulls it when deploying from dev or a branch that includes it).

- **Disable the 3rd-party POS printer (or set its no-print flag) in the Krypton/POS configuration.**
  This is a POS-side/vendor setting — not Nexus code. Confirm `NEXUS_PRINT_EVENTS_ENABLED=true` so the
  BT path (print bridge) keeps printing.
**Verify:** in Step 5, exactly one ticket prints (BT), POS receives the order but prints nothing.

## Step 4 — Print-bridge APK (PRN-REBUILD-APK)
Rebuild the Flutter release APK from current `main` and install on the Pi-connected tablet:
```bash
# on a build host with Flutter:
cd woosoo-print-bridge && flutter build apk --release
# then SCP + install on the Pi tablet (adb install -r <apk>)
```
**Verify:** the bridge connects (heartbeat green), prints a test ticket on the BT printer.

## Step 5 — Acceptance smoke test (the go-live gate)
On 3 tables with real tablets + the POS:
1. **Per-order terminal scoping:** place orders on 3 tablets; pay/close **one** order on the POS →
   **only that one tablet** returns to the welcome screen; the other two stay in-session.
2. **BT-only printing:** that order prints **exactly one** ticket, on the **BT** printer (no POS print).
3. **Live POS detail sync (new):** on an active order, **add a guest / change items on the POS** →
   that tablet's **guest count + total update live** (no refresh, no client recompute) via
   `order.details.updated`.
4. **WS resilience (TAB-CASE-009):** leave a tablet idle; confirm it recovers from a dropped socket
   (watchdog) rather than going stale.

**All four pass → release accepted.** Any failure → diagnose before opening to customers; rollback via Step 1.
